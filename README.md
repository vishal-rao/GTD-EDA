## Exploring terrorism through GTD 

Lack of understanding and awareness about global terrorism leads to diverse opinions and common misconceptions among civilians. Information on the subject is commonly ignored by the civilians who are not affected directly by the dangers. For the most part, terrorism is considered unpredictable and unfortunate calamity that strikes some parts of the world more than others. Based on the location of the events, people at large have very limited information about any such event happening in other parts of the world and hence react differently. In this project, we focus on terrorism by analysing the dataset provided by START (Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism) Consortium to extract meaningful patterns and statistics related to global terrorism.

During preliminary analysis, we noted a sharp rise in activities from 2011-2014 and a slight decrease followed. This pattern got us curiously interested and so we narrowed our time period of analyses to 2010 and beyond. Nevertheless, the main objective is to visualize the Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD) so that it can be useful for common man to understand the impact of various terrorist activities. Results from analyses as ours shall enable organizations and individuals to improve awareness of the severity of global terrorism, and also provide a reliable reference for counterterrorism initiatives. 

<b>I</b> Quantitative analysis of global terrorist activities and various attributes such as time, location and terrorist organizations involved in the activities <br/>
<b>II</b>  Data pre-processing, including data cleaning (such as missing value processing and data conversion), feature selection, and data splitting to treat missing              values row-wise.<br/>
<b>III</b> Visual analysis on the cleaned dataset producing several visualizations interpreted seeking answers to various questions posed at the beginning of the                    analysis. <br/>
We conclude our project by consolidating all interpretations in a finite set of results.


### Questions posed are as follows:

#### Exploring the state of terrorism in the World 
1.	What is the trend of activities over the years? 
2.	Which are the top 10 deadliest gangs? 
3.	Is there a shift in the dominant gangs in the chosen period as compared to rest of the years?
4.	Is there a relation between the weapon type chosen with target selected?
5.	Does the choice of weapon type vary with respect to the motive of the attack?
6.	What weapons are identified as causing a successful attack?
7.	Which weapon types result in higher property damage?
8.	How many of the attack types have been successful? If successful, which type has higher number of killed and wounded?
9.	Which attack types result in result in higher property damage?
10.	What is the trend of activities within regions?
11.	What is the highest attacked region? Which 5 countries within the identified region are attacked the most?
12.	What are the top 5 most active gangs and top 5 preferred attack type within the region?
13.	What is the trend in attack types suffered by the regions? 
14.	What is the state of property damage within the attacked regions?
15.	Which countries have suffered highest number of attacks?
16.	Which countries remain free from terrorism (suffering a maximum of 5 attacks)?

#### Exploring the state of terrorism in India
17.	What is the trend of activities in India?
18.	Which are the top 5 gangs, attack type and target type identified within India?
19.	Which cities have the highest number of kills and what are the groups responsible?
20.	What is the shift in the state of terrorism in India?


### Following were revealed as a result of our analysis:
1. Regions Middle East & North Africa and South Asia have suffered brutally as a result increased bombings and explosions between 2010 and 2016.
2. Terrorist groups Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Taliban, and Boko Haram have been identified as top 3 gangs responsible for majority of activities during this period.
3. While the countries like Estonia, Croatia, Morocco, Latvia have experienced not more than 2 activities, the state of terror remains of concern in Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.
4. There is more way more successful attacks than failed attacks.If the attack is successful then “Hostage taking” has the highest number of kills while more are wounded during hijacking
5. We can see that mainly “Explosives” are used for “POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, RELIGIOUS, OR SOCIAL GOAL” the most.While ”Firearms” are mainly used for “OUTSIDE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW”
